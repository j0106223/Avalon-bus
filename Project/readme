this is a media player project based on Intel DE2-115 FPGA and use NiosII softcore

in this project we will make a media player which can play song and show some control pannel on VGA screen and also controlled by buttons and switches, maybe it will add the ps/2 mouse keyboard function as well
Anyways I will use each peripherals if I can.

I2S:sound
VGA:
PS/2
PIO

nios2->risc-v
bare-metal -> rtos
